# Step 01 - Foundation Setup

## What Was Created

### Project Structure
- `/docs` - Documentation directory
- `/SoT` - Source of Truth directory  
- `/assets/css` - CSS stylesheets directory
- `/assets/js` - JavaScript files directory

### Core Files
- `index.html` - Main HTML page with semantic structure
- `assets/css/base.css` - Base stylesheet with reset and variables
- `assets/js/main.js` - Main JavaScript file with initialization

## Why These Files Were Created

### HTML Structure
- Semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) for better accessibility and SEO
- Proper linking to CSS and JavaScript assets
- Meta tags for responsive design and character encoding

### CSS Foundation
- CSS reset to ensure consistent rendering across browsers
- CSS custom properties (variables) for maintainable theming
- Container class for responsive layout management
- Font defaults for consistent typography

### JavaScript Initialization
- Strict mode for better error handling and performance
- Initialization function that logs when the application starts
- DOMContentLoaded event listener to ensure proper timing

## Purpose
This foundation provides a clean, semantic, and maintainable starting point for the Dao-Yu-101 project.
